# Workshop 1

## From linear to non-linear models

### Objective

In this workshop our objective is to implement a linear classifier on the MNIST data set, and then to add one hidden layer to create a non-linear decision boundary.

The MNIST data set contains binary images of handwritten digits and is used throughout the machine learning community to varify and test the performance of machine learning models. This data set is also easy to use with Tensorflow as it comes with pre-build functions to access training data, which is useful during the training procedure.

After you have tested the linear classifier your job is to add a hidden layer, play with the hyperparameters until you get good results, and compare your results to that of the simpler linear model.

The MNIST data set will be downloaded automatically within the notebook.
