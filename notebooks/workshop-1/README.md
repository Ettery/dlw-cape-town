# Workshop 1

## From linear to non-linear models

### Objective

In this workshop our objective is to implement a linear classifier on the MNIST dataset, and then to add one hidden layer to create a non-linear (more complex) decision boundary in an effort to improve the model's classification accuracy.

The MNIST dataset contains binary images of handwritten digits and is used throughout the machine learning community to varify and test the performance of machine learning algorithms. This dataset is also easy to use with ```Tensorflow``` as it comes with pre-build functions to access training data, which is useful during the training procedure.

After you have tested the linear classifier, your job is to add a hidden layer to your model. Then play with the hyperparameters until you get good results, and compare your results to that of your simpler linear model.

The MNIST dataset will be downloaded automatically within the notebook.
