# Workshop 3

## Convolutional and Recurrent neural networks

### Objective

In this workshop, we have two objectives:

1. Implement a convolutional neural network on the MNIST dataset,
2. Implement a recurrent neural network on ...

If you would like to get more real-world experience try the following exercise:

1. The `colour-challenge` has a dataset consisting of 9px by 9px (RGB) images of 18 different colours.
2. Implement any neural network classifier on this dataset and let us know what your best test set accuracy is, and what network configuration you used to achieve it.
