# Workshop 3

## Convolutional and Recurrent neural networks

### Objective

In this workshop we have two objectives:

1. Implement a convolutional neural network on the MNIST data set,
2. Implement a recurrent neural network on ...

If you would like to get more real-world experience try this exercise:

1. Download the ```data.pk``` (pickle file) data set from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1b2zwUWVVwdJkEAavMXv1D9wfjaG0Nf1W/view?usp=sharing). It consists of 9px by 9px (RGB) images of 18 different colours.
2. Implement any neural network classifier on this data set and let us know what your best test set accuracy is, and what network configuration you used.
